#### 4. **Arduino Integration** (arduino/reactorSketch/)
The Arduino code provides physical feedback through:

**Serial Command Protocol**:
- `'p' + value (0-250)`: Power level → Blue LED brightness
- `'c' + value (20-180)`: Coolant flow → Pump motor speed  
- `'r' + value (5-140)`: Rod position → Servo angle

## Physics and Mathematical Model

### Neutron Kinetics Equations

The simulator solves the coupled point kinetics equations with 6 delayed neutron groups and an external neutron source:

```math
\frac{dn}{dt} = \frac{\rho - \beta}{\Lambda}n + \sum_{i=1}^{6}\lambda_i C_i + S
```

```math
\frac{dC_i}{dt} = \frac{\beta_i}{\Lambda}n - \lambda_i C_i
```

Where:
- $n$ = neutron population density
- $C_i$ = delayed neutron precursor concentration for group i
- $\rho$ = reactivity (includes temperature feedback)
- $\beta$ = total delayed neutron fraction
- $\beta_i$ = delayed neutron fraction for group i
- $\Lambda$ = prompt neutron lifetime
- $\lambda_i$ = decay constant for group i
- $S$ = external neutron source strength (n/cm³/s), representing spontaneous fission, startup sources, or (α,n) reactions

### Reactivity Feedback

The total reactivity includes contributions from:
- **Excess Reactivity**: Initial core excess reactivity ($0.05) for subcritical startup
- **Control Rod Position**: Primary control mechanism ($0.2 total worth)
- **Fuel Temperature**: Doppler broadening effect (negative feedback)
- **Coolant Temperature**: Moderator temperature coefficient (negative feedback)
- **Xenon-135 Poisoning**: Transient neutron absorption (negative, time-dependent)
- **Samarium-149 Poisoning**: Equilibrium neutron absorption (negative, builds slowly)
- **Fuel Burnup**: U-235 depletion and Pu-239 buildup effects (negative over long timescales)

### Thermal Hydraulics

Fuel temperature evolution:
```math
\frac{dT_f}{dt} = \frac{Q_{fission} - h \cdot A_c (T_f - T_c)}{m_f \cdot C_{p,fuel}}
```

Coolant temperature evolution:
```math
\frac{dT_c}{dt} = \frac{h \cdot A_c (T_f - T_c) + \dot{m}_c \cdot C_{p,coolant}(T_{in} - T_c)}{m_c \cdot C_{p,coolant}}
```

Where:
- $Q_{fission}$ = fission power generated
- $h$ = heat transfer coefficient (flow-dependent)
- $A_c$ = fuel-coolant contact area (4 × 10⁵ cm²)
- $\dot{m}_c$ = coolant mass flow rate
- $C_p$ = specific heat capacity

## Reactor Operation Demonstrations

### Manual Power Control Mode
**Initial Condition before activating the Power Control Mode:**
![Power Control Mode initial](Media/Images/Power%20Control%20Mode%20Before%20Before.png)
**After activating the Power Control Mode for a targeted power:**
![Power Control Mode After](Media/Images/Power%20Control%20Mode%20After.png)
Autometically adjust the control rod position through PID controller to achieve the targeted power level.

### Manual Flow Control Mode
**Initial Condition before activating the Flow Control Mode:**
![Flow Control Mode before](Media/Images/Flow%20Control%20Mode%20Before.png)
**After activating the Flow Control Mode and Changing the Flow rate:**
![Flow Control Mode After](Media/Images/Flow%20Control%20Mode%20After.png)

Independent coolant flow control enables investigation of thermal-hydraulic effects decoupled from automatic power-based control.

### Startup Transient
![Reactor Startup - Exponential Power Rise](Media/Images/Reactor%20Startup%20exponential%20power%20rise.png)

This image demonstrates a typical reactor startup sequence showing exponential power rise as control rods are withdrawn. The behavior follows the reactor period equation demonstrating subcritical to critical transition.

### Prompt Jump Phenomenon
![Reactor Prompt Jump Transient](Media/Images/Prompt%20Jump.png)

This captures a reactivity insertion accident resulting in a prompt jump. When we activate the Prompt jump Mode, a reactivity of 0.003$ is being inserted instantly, causing an instantaneous power jump followed by temperature feedback stabilization.

### SCRAM Event
![Reactor SCRAM Event](Media/Images/Reactor%20SCARM.png)

Here the SCARM is triggred by the manual SCARM button. Shows rapid power decrease as control rods are fully inserted and negative reactivity is added. An automatic SCRAM (Safety Control Rod Axe Man) event can be also triggered by exceeding temperature safety limits.

### Xenon and Samarium Poisoning
![Xenon and Samarium Concentrations](Media/Images/Xenon%20%26%20Samarium%20Poison%20Graph.png)

Long-term simulation showing fission product poison buildup:
- **Xenon-135**: Reaches equilibrium in ~40-50 hours with characteristic oscillations
- **Samarium-149**: Builds slowly over days, approaching stable equilibrium
- Both poisons insert negative reactivity requiring compensating rod withdrawal

### Burnup & Isptope Depletion
![Burnup and Isotope Depletion](Media/Images/Burnup%20&%20Isotope%20Depletion.png)

Shows the Continuous Burnup of fuel and the continuous change in concentration of the nuclides due to Burnup.

3. Watch reactivity approach zero dollars
4. Continue rod withdrawal until desired power is reached
5. Fine-tune position to stabilize at target power

#### Understanding Reactivity
- **Subcritical** ($ρ < 0$): Power decreasing, reactor shutting down
- **Critical** ($ρ = 0$): Power stable, equilibrium condition
- **Supercritical** ($ρ > 0$): Power increasing

#### Temperature Monitoring
- **Fuel Temperature**: Must stay below 1700 K (automatic SCRAM above)
- **Coolant Temperature**: Must stay below 700 K (automatic SCRAM above)
- Temperature increases lag behind power changes due to thermal inertia
- Higher coolant flow improves heat removal and lowers temperatures

- **Long-Term Studies**: Ideal for analyzing poison transients and equilibrium behavior

### Safety Systems

The simulator includes realistic safety features:

1. **Automatic SCRAM Triggers**:
   - Fuel temperature > 1700 K
   - Coolant temperature > 700 K
   - Both conditions cause immediate rod insertion

2. **SCRAM Recovery**:
   - Click SCRAM button again to unlock
   - Reactor must be manually restarted from subcritical state
   - Delayed neutron precursors must rebuild (takes 30-60 seconds)

## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

**Q: Is this simulator accurate for real reactor design?**  
A: No. DUNE uses simplified point kinetics and 0D thermal hydraulics suitable for education and conceptual understanding. Real reactor design requires detailed 3D neutronics and CFD analysis.

**Q: Can I use this for homework/projects?**  
A: Yes! The software is open source and free to use for educational purposes. Please cite this repository in your work.

**Q: How realistic are the physics models?**  
A: The 6-group delayed neutron model is standard for training simulators. Thermal hydraulics are simplified but capture essential behavior. Good for qualitative understanding, not quantitative design.

**Q: Why does the reactor SCRAM when I withdraw rods too quickly?**  
A: Rapid rod withdrawal causes power to rise exponentially. Power heats the fuel, and if temperature limits are exceeded, automatic SCRAM occurs. This demonstrates the importance of controlled startups.

**Q: What's the difference between dollars and absolute reactivity?**  
A: Reactivity in dollars ($) is normalized by β (delayed neutron fraction). $1.00 is the prompt critical threshold. Absolute reactivity ρ has units of Δk/k.

**Q: Can I modify the reactor parameters?**  
A: Yes! Edit `reactorPhysics.py` to change core size, fuel type, temperature coefficients, control rod worth, etc. Rerun `python setup.py develop` after changes.

**Q: Why is there a delay after SCRAM before I can restart?**  
A: Delayed neutron precursors (with half-lives of 0.2 to 55 seconds) must decay. Real reactors also have xenon buildup considerations. In this simulator, Xe-135 concentration affects restart capability.

**Q: What's the difference between Xenon-135 and Samarium-149?**  
A: Xenon-135 is a transient poison (9.2 hour half-life) with very high absorption cross-section (2.6M barns). It builds up and decays relatively quickly. Samarium-149 is effectively stable with lower absorption (40.8K barns) but builds slowly through a longer decay chain and represents permanent reactivity loss.

**Q: Does this work on Raspberry Pi?**  
A: It should work but may be slow. The GUI is computationally intensive. Consider using a more powerful computer for smooth operation.
